    "# Problem 1: Basics of Neural Networks\n",
    "* <b>Learning Objective:</b> In this problem, you are asked to implement a basic multi-layer fully connected neural network from scratch, including forward and backward passes of certain essential layers, to perform an image classification task on the CIFAR100 dataset. You need to implement essential functions in different indicated python files under directory `lib`.\n",
    "* <b>Provided Code:</b> We provide the skeletons of classes you need to complete. Forward checking and gradient checkings are provided for verifying your implementation as well.\n",
    "* <b>TODOs:</b> You are asked to implement the forward passes and backward passes for standard layers and loss functions, various widely-used optimizers, and part of the training procedure. And finally we want you to train a network from scratch on your own. Also, there are inline questions you need to answer. See `README.md` to set up your environment."
